Product Report
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key product metrics and behaviors.

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as product name, category, subcategory, and cost.
    2. Segments products by revenue to identify High-Performers, Mid-Range, or Low-Performers.
    3. Aggregates product-level metrics:
        - total orders
        - total sales
        - total quantity sold
        - total customers (unique)
        - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
        - recency (months since last sale)
        - average order revenue (AOR)
        - average monthly revenue
